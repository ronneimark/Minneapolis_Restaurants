The speed rack had been placed outside of the walk-in cooler for some time that afternoon for the same reasons the onions were. Based on discussion of how long the meatballs were out of refrigeration (less than an hour), the fact that they were cooling quickly now that they had been returned to the walk-in cooler, and the fact that they would be cooked before serving, CFM did not discard meatballs.',\n",

CFM immediately trained staff not to return hot product to product that is in cold holding. Because the hot broth had been added very recently, and the temperature of the combined product was already below 70F, inspector and CFM determined the product could be salvaged rather than discarded.

To review, this is the current HACCP status:   1) The violation for ROP without a HACCP plan was noted last year and orders issued to discontinue vacuum packaging. No HACCP plan has been submitted.    2) The variance to ROP some items for under 48 hours without a HACCP plan was revoked by this inspector following last year's inspection - due to misuse. The establishment inquired what they needed to do to get the variance reinstated, but have not followed through by submitting a complete request form.    3) The variance to ROP non-PHF items without a HACCP plan was not revoked, but it was also not observed in use and inspector recommended the establishment update the variance to describe exactly what non-PHF they wanted to vacuum package   Among the food items found vacuum packaged without approval were: numerous types of raw meat, meat loaf mix of raw meat and cooked ingredients, raw salmon that was packaged when fresh then frozen, and cooked pork vieja. Persons in charge opened and discarded all cooked items and raw fish due to significant risk described by inspector. Persons in Charge kept the raw meats, returning them to freezer and agreeing not to use them until a HACCP inspector could assess the relative risk. This inspector will request a HACCP Inspector to contact persons in charge.         A citation will be issued for this repeated use of Reduced Oxygen Packaging without a HACCP Plan. Inspector recommends the vacuum packaging machine be removed from the establishment.        Inspector showed chef the HACCP webpage with complete information and with template plans and recommended they begin with developing a plan for raw meats to be ROP packaged:  http://www.minneapolismn.gov/health/inspections/HACCP\",\n",

One such case was for a guest J. Petraborg in late October 2017, which the inspector took a picture of. The follow up indicated on the form was \"call and email 10/30\".   This failure to report such a customer complaint of illness is negligent and concerning. Inspector discussed the scenario in which the customer may be ill from another source - such as food at another licensed facility - an which the Minnesota Department of Health can only address if the information is brought to them.

Based on observation, it is assumed the products would not have met the requirement (to reach 70F or lower before two hours elapsed). Intervention was made immediately to finish cooling the products rapidly so they would not need to be discarded.   Therefore, this item is being marked as NOT OBSERVED.

These products had been partially cooled using the equipment available, then put (still very warm) into deep storage containers. Temperatures in Chicken Parm sauce were 89F on the inside of the product and 78F along the outside of the container. This is not acceptable, and puts the products at high risk for causing bacterial intoxication in those who later consume the reheated product. When warm products are put into deep plastic containers, cooling significantly slows.   Discussion with persons in charge and prep cooks indicated the  products had not been in the cooling phase long enough to pass the two hour threshold for needing to discard.   Products were rapidly cooled using a combination of spreading out in shallow hotel pans in the walk in freezer and submersion in ice bath with ice wands.   Person in Charge ordered additional cooling wands and large, shallow hotel pans that same afternoon, to provide the equipment needed to consistently cool prepared PHFs.',\n",

If the freezer will be removed and no plug in freezer or cooler are present, the dry wall and floor can simply be painted with a good quality paint to make them smooth and easily cleanable. The brick wall will need to be covered with a smooth, easily cleanable surface.      If the freezer remains, or if other plug-in freezer or cooler units are added, the higher standards of a food prep space are required. The wall behind and extending out from the plug-in units must be RFP. The floor under and extending out from the plug-in units must be quarry tile or an approved epoxy resinous system. Both quarry tile and epoxy resinous system would need an integral base cove at the wall/floor junctures.',\n",

However, in the lower level walk-in cooler, the following items were observed at dangerously warm temperatures due to procedural practices:       1) Cooked onions in a medium sized plastic container were found in the walk-in cooler at 54F. The onions had been placed outside of the walk in cooler for some time that afternoon due to space constraints, as staff added deliveries and organized prepared products. CFM discarded the cooked onions.    2) Uncooked meat balls on sheet trays of speed rack were found in the walk-in cooler at 47F. The speed rack had been placed outside of the walk-in cooler for some time that afternoon for the same reasons the onions were. Based on discussion of how long the meatballs were out of refrigeration (less than an hour), the fact that they were cooling quickly now that they had been returned to the walk-in cooler, and the fact that they would be cooked before serving, CFM did not discard meatballs.',\n",

The broth had been made two days prior and CFM had verified proper cooling at that time.  It was initially unclear why the broth was so warm; discussion with kitchen staff revealed that a portion had been taken out, used for cooking meatballs, then returned hot to the container.   CFM immediately trained staff not to return hot product to product that is in cold holding. Because the hot broth had been added very recently, and the temperature of the combined product was already below 70F, inspector and CFM determined the product could be salvaged rather than discarded. CFM had staff divide the broth into smaller containers, immerse in ice bath, and stir with ice wands. Inspector emphasized the value of using metal containers instead of plastic.',\n",

To review, this is the current HACCP status:   1) The violation for ROP without a HACCP plan was noted last year and orders issued to discontinue vacuum packaging. No HACCP plan has been submitted.    2) The variance to ROP some items for under 48 hours without a HACCP plan was revoked by this inspector following last year's inspection - due to misuse. The establishment inquired what they needed to do to get the variance reinstated, but have not followed through by submitting a complete request form.    3) The variance to ROP non-PHF items without a HACCP plan was not revoked, but it was also not observed in use and inspector recommended the establishment update the variance to describe exactly what non-PHF they wanted to vacuum package   Among the food items found vacuum packaged without approval were: numerous types of raw meat, meat loaf mix of raw meat and cooked ingredients, raw salmon that was packaged when fresh then frozen, and cooked pork vieja. Persons in charge opened and discarded all cooked items and raw fish due to significant risk described by inspector. Persons in Charge kept the raw meats, returning them to freezer and agreeing not to use them until a HACCP inspector could assess the relative risk. This inspector will request a HACCP Inspector to contact persons in charge.         A citation will be issued for this repeated use of Reduced Oxygen Packaging without a HACCP Plan. Inspector recommends the vacuum packaging machine be removed from the establishment.        Inspector showed chef the HACCP webpage with complete information and with template plans and recommended they begin with developing a plan for raw meats to be ROP packaged:  http://www.minneapolismn.gov/health/inspections/HACCP\",\n",

One such case was for a guest J. Petraborg in late October 2017, which the inspector took a picture of. The follow up indicated on the form was \"call and email 10/30\".   This failure to report such a customer complaint of illness is negligent and concerning. Inspector discussed the scenario in which the customer may be ill from another source - such as food at another licensed facility - an which the Minnesota Department of Health can only address if the information is brought to them.   A citation is being issued.

No clear record of the date of vacuum packaging was available. The violation specific to the order in this Item is as follows:          Based on the observed quantity of smoked ham and discussion with staff, it was understood that the ham would be used beyond the current service period - resulting in a repeat violation of holding prepared, potentially hazardous food for more than 7 days. Following discussion with Chef, he determined the smoked ham would be taken out of service and utilized for staff meal only.',\n",

Based on observation, it is assumed the products would not have met the requirement (to reach 70F or lower before two hours elapsed). Intervention was made immediately to finish cooling the products rapidly so they would not need to be discarded.   Therefore, this item is being marked as NOT OBSERVED.   Ensuring that prepared PHFs like sauces cool quickly enough to meet the required parameters is essential to preventing foodborne illness by bacterial intoxication.

These products had been partially cooled using the equipment available, then put (still very warm) into deep storage containers. Temperatures in Chicken Parm sauce were 89F on the inside of the product and 78F along the outside of the container. This is not acceptable, and puts the products at high risk for causing bacterial intoxication in those who later consume the reheated product. When warm products are put into deep plastic containers, cooling significantly slows.   Discussion with persons in charge and prep cooks indicated the  products had not been in the cooling phase long enough to pass the two hour threshold for needing to discard.   Products were rapidly cooled using a combination of spreading out in shallow hotel pans in the walk in freezer and submersion in ice bath with ice wands.   Person in Charge ordered additional cooling wands and large, shallow hotel pans that same afternoon, to provide the equipment needed to consistently cool prepared PHFs.',\n",
