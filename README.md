# Minneapolis_Restaurants
Project 3


To set up the backend, from the folder "Minneapolis Restaurant Backend":
  
  1) Run python script backend.py in the terminal.
  2) Run DataTypeChanger script in PGAdmin to fix the data types.
  
 At that point, you should be able to run the Flask Server (app.py) from the main folder and access all of the site.
